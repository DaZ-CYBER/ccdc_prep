Some things to look for (from last year's Web Admin runbook)

1. Assets List
  - Look over each box and find any unregistered web servers
  - Nmap subnet and look for 80 or 443
    - Web servers not registered need to be deleted or killed
    
2. Remove users from OpenGTS and Gitea
3. Configure modsecurity on OpenGTS
4. Set up OpenGTS config (w/ steps in other doc)
