Crontab

CRON is a built-in Linux system that allows for the machine to automate jobs to perform minor system processes much easier.
- These jobs are called cronjobs.
  - Cronjobs are allowed to be scheduled to perform at a certain time.

NETSTAT

- Netstat is a command-line function that can be used to look up all ports and services connected to the system
  - Aside from Cron, this can also be used to locate suspicious connections.
  
  - # netstat -a
    - # netstat --help | gives a very in depth look at each flag and what it does.

CRONJOBS

- As explained previously, cronjobs are scheduled jobs. They are located within the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory.

- # crontab -l
  - This command will output any cronjobs on the user's account.
  - This command can be used on regular user's accounts, however the crontabs folder should only be accessible to root users.
  
- Attackers have the ability to place a backdoor into these jobs, due to the fact that they execute their files at a specific time.
- Examining these files for any backdoor commands(such as netcat), can help identify a malicious cronjob from a regular one.

- # crontab -r (user's cronjob)

SETTING UP AN EXAMPLE CRONJOB

Basic Elements to setting up a Cronjob:

- # a b c d e /directory/command output
  - a = Minute
  - b = Hour
  - c = Day
  - d = Month
  - e = Day of the week
  
- Type in the following to edit crontab:
  - # crontab -e
- It should prompt you to select an editor. I am most familiar with vim however nano is an easy substitution.
