User Permissions

CHMOD - File/Directory Permissions

  - "chmod" allows us to change the permissions of the file or directory that we tell it to do
  - There are three user types that correspond with the permission parameters.
    - Owner       : Parameter 1
    - Group       : Parameter 2
    - Other Users : Parameter 3
    
    - # chmod 0(Owner)0(Group)0(Other user)

    - 0: None               - Not able to read, write, or execute the file/directory.
    - 1: Write              - User is able to write on the file/directory.
    - 2: Execute            - User is able to execute the file/directory.
    - 3: Write/Execute      - User is able to write on and execute the file/directory.
    - 4: Read               - User is able to read the file/directory.
    - 5: Read/Write         - User is able to read and write on the file/directory.
    - 6: Read/Execute       - User is able to read and execute the file/directory.
    - 7: Read/Write/Execute - User has all permissions and can read/write/execute the file/directory.

    Example 1: # chmod 777 file.txt
    - This command will give the ability to read, write, and execute to the owner, group, and any other users.
    
    Example 2: # chmod 542 file.txt
    - This command will do the following:
      - Owner will have the permission to only read/write the file.
      - Groups will have the permission to only read the file.
      - Other users can only execute the file.
    

CHOWN - File/Directory Owner

  - chown allows us to change the owner of the file/directory.
    - chown is relatively simple but can also be used to change the group the file was created in.
    
    # chown root file.txt
    - Changes the owner of file.txt to root
    
    - As explained previously, you can also change the group of the file by using a colon to separate the owner and the group.
    # chown root:root file.txt
    - This will change the owner of the file to root and also change the group of the file to the root group.
    
    - It's important to remember the users and groups when you're assigning file owners.
      - Users and their passwords are stored in /etc/password
      - Groups are stored in /etc/group
      
CURL/GIT

 - curl allows us to direct data from a server or website.
  - Supported protocols are HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP, or FILE.
  
  - # curl http://google.com
  - (This can also be used to direct raw github user content back to us.
  
 - git allows us to perform actions within github architecture. We can do the following:
  - Create repositories in either existing hierarchical repositories or completely empty ones.
  - Edit repositories that we currently have.
  - Clone and use repositories on our machine from other creators.
  
  - # git clone https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng
