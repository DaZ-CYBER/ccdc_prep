SSH CONFIGURATION

- SSH is one of the most important configurations in Linux to secure.
  - A unproperly configured SSH server can allow attackers to plant backdoors or gain remote shells into your server.
- To check whether or not your machine has OpenSSH installed, you can type the following into most Linux distro command lines.

  - # apt search openssh-client
 
 - The machine will tell you whether or not it is installed, and if it isn't, perform the following
  
  - # apt-get update
  - # apt update
  - # apt-get install openssh-server

- The SSH configuration file is normally under ~/.ssh or /etc/ssh. An example of the file format is as follows.
